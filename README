This is the initial README file for a short-lived project.

= About this Document =

There is nothing to see here. I'm just testing a code-review cicle using
GitHub's "Pull Request" feature.

= Pull requests =

So, the main idea about using Githubs's pull requests for code review is
that its interface allows for commenting files on a line-by-line basis
and other forms of dicussions about the code pertaining the change
purposed by the pull request.

The big question is: do updates in the branch the pull request is comming from
reflect in the pull request? Will comments made to a given line of code move
follow those updates?
